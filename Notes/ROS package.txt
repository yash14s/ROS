ROS installation is in /opt/ros/noetic
ROS project is called a package. Package is defined inside a workspace which is where we create all the programs of a ROS project.

1.Create a new ROS package:
i cd catkin_ws/src
ii catkin_create_pkg ros_practice std_msgs rospy roscpp
where ros_practice is the name of the package, and std_msgs, rospy and roscpp are the dependencies in this case.

2. Compile the newly created package
i cd.. (cd to catkin_ws)
ii catkin_make
Inside ~/catkin_ws/src, ros_practice is created.
ros_practice contains include, src. Inside include we put the libraries and src contains source code.

3.Testing:
i from ros_essentials, copy talker.cpp and listener.cpp and paste them here.
ii modify CMakeList such that the name of node is unique. Refer to ros_essential_cpp's CMakeList
iii cd to catkin_ws
iv catkin_make

4.To execute:
i ensure roscore is running in terminal(A)
ii in terminal(B) run: rosrun ros_practice talker_ros_node
iii in terminal(C) run: rosrun ros_practice listener_ros_node

5.Deleting a ROS package (not elegant method)
i cd to catkin_ws
ii delete the build and devel folders
iii $ catkin_make clean
iv $ catkin_make


Notes:
CMakeLists.txt file describes how to build the code and where to install it. It's the input to the CMake build system for building software packages.
package.xml is used to describe the package and build its dependencies. It's automatically generated
